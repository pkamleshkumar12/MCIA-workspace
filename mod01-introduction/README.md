# 1. Introducing integration solution architectures

- To address the **in-scope requirements** of **stakeholders** related to the integration scenarios and use cases.
    - Document **different views** to address these **goals** and **concerns**
    - Additional documentation may be required to align stakeholders from **different business units** or **job roles**

- Integration solution architecture
    - Builds a technology blueprint that guides the integration of enterprise applications
    - Documents individual integration solutions
        - For example, message-based integration, batch processing, and ETL
        - Often in the form of direct integration between two systems

    - Functional Requirements (FRs)
    - Non-functional Requirements (NFRs)
    - Service-level agreements (SLAs)
